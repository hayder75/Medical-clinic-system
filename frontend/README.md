This is the frontend application for the Medical Clinic System.

## Quick Start

1. **Install Node.js** (if not already installed)
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
   - Choose LTS version
   - Install and restart your computer

2. **Install Dependencies**

   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```cmd
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open Browser**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3001

## Configuration

The `.env` file contains the backend API URL pointing to the VPS server:

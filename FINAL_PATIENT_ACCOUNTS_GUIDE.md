# Patient Accounts - Final Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ What Changed

### Both CREDIT and ADVANCE work the SAME way now!

**Both account types:**
1. Patient deposits money upfront (credit limit or advance balance)
2. When paying for services, click "Use patient account balance" checkbox
3. Money gets deducted from their account
4. Works exactly the same!

## üìä The Difference:

### ADVANCE Account (Prepaid Medical Services):
- **Purpose:** Patient pre-pays for future services
- **Deposit:** Real money received (counts in daily cash)
- **Usage:** Deducts from balance when services used
- **Daily Cash:** Deposit counts as money received

### CREDIT Account (Credit Line/Limit):
- **Purpose:** Patient has a credit limit to use
- **Deposit:** Credit amount set (does NOT count in daily cash - it's not real money yet)
- **Usage:** Deducts from balance when services used
- **Payment Later:** When patient pays, THEN it counts in daily cash

## üîÑ Complete Workflow

### For ADVANCE Account:

**Day 1: Patient Deposits**
- Admin creates ADVANCE account
- Patient deposits 10,000 ETB cash
- Balance: 10,000 ETB
- **Daily Cash: +10,000 ETB** ‚úÖ

**Day 2: Patient Uses Services**
- Services cost 3,000 ETB
- Check "Use patient account balance"
- Balance: 7,000 ETB
- **Daily Cash: 0 ETB** (already counted)
- Services proceed ‚úÖ

### For CREDIT Account:

**Day 1: Set Credit Limit**
- Admin creates CREDIT account
- Set credit limit: 10,000 ETB
- Balance: 10,000 ETB (credit available, not real money)
- **Daily Cash: 0 ETB** (no real money received)

**Day 2: Patient Uses Credit**
- Services cost 3,000 ETB
- Check "Use patient account balance"
- Balance: 7,000 ETB (7k credit remaining)
- **Daily Cash: 0 ETB** (using credit limit, not real money)
- Services proceed ‚úÖ

**Day 3: Patient Pays Back**
- Patient returns with 3,000 ETB cash
- Click "Accept Payment" on account
- Pay 3,000 ETB
- Balance: 10,000 ETB (credit limit restored)
- **Daily Cash: +3,000 ETB** ‚úÖ (REAL money received!)

## üéØ How It Shows in Billing:

### When Processing Payment:

**For ADVANCE Account:**
- Shows: "Account Balance: ETB 10,000 (Advance)" in GREEN box
- Checkbox: "Use patient account balance (ETB 10,000 available)"

**For CREDIT Account:**
- Shows: "Account Balance: ETB 10,000 (Credit Available)" in BLUE box
- Checkbox: "Use patient account balance (ETB 10,000 available)"

**Both work the same when checkbox is checked!**

## üí° Key Points:

1. **Both deduct money from account** when using services
2. **Both show in billing** with checkbox to use balance
3. **ADVANCE deposits count in daily cash** (real money)
4. **CREDIT limit does NOT count in daily cash** (until they pay)
5. **CREDIT payments count in daily cash** (when they pay back)
6. **Horizontal scroll works** for small screens

## üìù Summary:

**They're the same!** Just different reasons for use:
- ADVANCE = "I'm prepaying for future services"
- CREDIT = "I have a credit line, will pay later"

Both use the exact same "Use account balance" checkbox in billing! üéâ

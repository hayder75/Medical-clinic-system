## The Math:

**Starting Point:**
- Balance: -5,000 ETB (owes 5,000)

**After 1st Payment:**
- Paid: 2,000 ETB
- New Balance: -3,000 ETB (owes 3,000)
- Debt DECREASED ✅

**After 2nd Payment:**
- Paid: 3,000 ETB  
- New Balance: 0 ETB (fully paid)
- Debt CLEARED ✅

---

## Summary:

**"Accept Payment" DOES decrease the debt!**

The formula is simple:
```
New Balance = Current Balance + Payment Amount

-5,000 + 2,000 = -3,000 (debt decreases)
-3,000 + 3,000 = 0 (debt cleared)
```

Adding to a negative number makes it LESS negative (closer to 0)!
